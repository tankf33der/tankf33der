HOW TO TYPE KOREAN HANGUL AND HANJA IN WINCALIS/UNIEDIT</h1></center></B><hr>

<P>Select one of the Hangul keyboards in the "Korean" submenu of the "Language" menu. 
There are four different Hangul keyboards to choose from:  the Phonetic keyboard, the 
Standard keyboard, the Kong keyboard, and the Morse keyboard.

<P>When you have selected one of the keyboards, until you are familiar with the location of 
the keys, you can display a "virtual keyboard" picture on the screen by selecting "Keyboard 
Help" under the Help menu. Press or click on the Shift keys to display the shifted keys.

<P>The Phonetic keyboard is the typical student keyboard.  The consonants and the vowels are 
arranged to reflect the similar sounds of the Roman alphabet.  For example, the consonant á„‘ is 
located on the "p" key, and the vowel á…¡ is located on the "a" key. Thus, it may be the easiest 
keyboard for a native English speaker to use. However, some Korean letters do not have an 
equivalent in English, and thus are placed on unused keys on the keyboard. For example, á„‹ is 
located on the "q" key with no relevance to sound (but a mnemonic association with the shape 
of the letter "Q").  Likewise,á…¢looks a little like a "Z" on its side, so it is on the "z" key; and á…³ , 
which is romanized Å­ (a "double u") is on the "w" key. The user must become familiar with these 
"exception" letters.

<P>The Standard keyboard, as suggested by its name, is the standard keyboard in Korea (the Korean 
typewriter keyboard). Thus, it is probably the keyboard that a native Korean would be familiar with.  
It is divided into two parts:  The vowels are located on the right half of the keyboard, and the 
consonants are located on the left half of the keyboard.

<P>The Kong keyboard is separated into three parts:  The initial letters (consonants, such as á„€, 
á„ƒ, etc.) are placed on the right third of the keyboard.  The medial letters (vowels such as á…¡, 
á…¢, etc.) are placed on the middle third of the keyboard.  The final letters (consonants) are on the 
left third of the keyboard. The user must be aware of these differences.  For example, although 
the initial and the final consonants look the same (á„‚, a initial on the "h" key, and a á†«, final 
on the "s"  key), they cannot be used interchangeably.

<P>The Morse keyboard, among the four, requires the greatest number of keystrokes to type.  There 
are no compound vowels, only simple.  Thus, the user must combine the simple vowels to make 
compound vowels.  For example, á…¡+á…µ=á…¢.  In addition, the vowels and consonants are 
scattered about the keyboard in relation to frequency of use and convenience of layout of the 
particular letter (similar to the arrangement of the English keyboard).  

<h4>HANGUL-HANJA CONVERSION</h4>
<blockquote>
	Hangul-to-Hanja  (F8)
</blockquote><p>
To convert the syllable or word to the left of the insertion point (the blinking caret) written in 
Hangul into its Hanja equivalent, press the F8 function key, or click on the menu item Tools, 
Language Options, Korean Options, Hangul-to-Hanja. (One of the Korean language keyboards 
must be the currently selected keyboard.)  For example, to convert ë„ì„œê´€â€ƒto  åœ–æ›¸é¤¨ , 
press F8 with the insertion point to the right of ë„ì„œê´€ . If there are homophone equivalents, 
they will appear in a Selection Window. Choose the desired equivalent.

<P><blockquote>
	Hanja-to-Hangul  (F7)
</blockquote><p>
To convert the syllable or word to the left of the insertion point (the blinking caret) written in 
Hanja into its Hangul equivalent, press the F7 function key, or click on the menu item Tools, 
Language Options, Korean Options, Hanja-to-Hangul. (One of the Korean language keyboards 
must be the currently selected keyboard.)  For example, to convert éŸ“åœ‹â€ƒto  í•œêµ­ , press F7 
with the insertion point to the right of éŸ“åœ‹ .If there is more than one Hangul equivalent (i.e., 
there is more than one reading for the Hanja), they will appear in a Selection Window. Choose 
the desired equivalent.

<p>You can also enter Korean Hanja characters through two other methods:

<ul>
<li><b>Shape-based coding</b><br>

Under the Language menu, select the "Hanja by shape" keyboard in the Korean submenu. For details 
on this method see the topic Cangjie Input Method in On-line Help.
 
<li><b>Unicode browsing</b><br>

For details on this method see the topic The Unicode Character Selection Dialog Box in On-line 
Help.
</ul>
<h4>HOW TO TYPE KOREAN TRANSLITERATION</h4>

In order to type the special o with breve (Å) and u with breve (Å­) characters necessary for the 
Korean Ministry of Education or McCune-Reischauer romanization, you may choose the 
"Korean Transliteration" keyboard in the Korean submenu, as well as one of the other general 
transliteration keyboards. You can type the base vowel "o" or "u," then press the overstrike key 
F2, then type the mnemonic accent key for the breve "u"; or you can type them directly by pressing 
"q" or "f" for "Å" and "x" or "v" for "Å­."
