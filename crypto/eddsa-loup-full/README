Run the tests
-------------

Compare with Blake2b:

    $ make clean
    $ make

Compare with SHA512 (full ed25519 compliance):

    $ make clean
    $ make "USER_FLAGS=-DED25519_SHA512"


Modified libraries
------------------

`tweetnacl.c` has been tweaked at the very end to add Blake2b support.
It relies on the ED25519_SHA512 macro just like Monocypher.  It is
otherwise untouched.

`ed25519-donna/ed25519-hash-custom.h` has been updated to support both
Blake2b and SHA-512.  This is the standard mechanism for custom hash
support in ed25519-donna.


Dependencies
------------

Libsodium provides the hash functions to the donna implementation (to
avoid relying on Monocypher, which we are testing here). It needs to be
installed on your system, and be reachable with pkgconfig.
