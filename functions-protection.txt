#{
   User of hash function call (tiger) function with a list, it returns 
   a list of internal state as result of hash:
      (tiger (mapcar char (chop "abc")))
   Internal states:
   o) A  - changed in (combine)
   o) Y0 - changed in (dump) via (combine) calls

   Questions:
   o) if user knows names of variables, can he overwrite them, after 
      load my library as (load "tiger.l") ?
   o) if user already have variables A and Y0 somewhere in code will I
      overwrite them after (combines) and (dump) calls
}#


# Pseudo code as tiges.l
#
(de dump NIL
   (setq Y0 (+ Y0 64)) )
(de combine ("A" X)
   (set "A" (x| (val "A") X))
   (dump) )
(de tiger (Lst)
   (let (A 0  Y0 77)
      (for N Lst
         (combine 'A N) )
      (list A Y0) ) )
